HomePage.tsx Status Review:
- Lines 149-178: Mixed handleSendMessage logic with duplicate blocks and a trailing 'else {'.
- Lines 286-287: simulateGeneration ends, but simulateVideoResult is missing below it.
- Lines 632: VideoResultCard thumbnail uses msg.data?.avatarImage (now supported by type update).
- Lines 671-683: MessageInputBox props are correctly updated.

Cleanup Plan:
1. Replace lines 149-178 with a clean handleSendMessage.
2. Insert simulateVideoResult after simulateGeneration.
